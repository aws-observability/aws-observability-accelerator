Welcome to the AWS Observability Accelerator!

The AWS Observability Accelerator help you set up observability for your AWS environments with AWS-managed observability services such as Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, Amazon Managed Grafana, AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) and Amazon CloudWatch.

This repository provide shared artifacts (documentation, dashboards, alerting rules) for the [Terraform](https://github.com/aws-observability/terraform-aws-observability-accelerator) and [CDK](https://github.com/aws-observability/cdk-aws-observability-accelerator) projects. This repository also serves as a GitOps source repository.

Checkout the project documentation for [Terraform](https://aws-observability.github.io/terraform-aws-observability-accelerator/) and [CDK](https://aws-observability.github.io/cdk-aws-observability-accelerator/) projects for more information.


**Disclaimer:** Some of the dashboards have been inspired from the [Prometheus Monitoring Mixin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes-monitoring/kubernetes-mixin),
enhanced to work with AWS Observability services.
